Portfolio Management

To make the most of one's investment portfolio investors must participate actively in portfolio
management. By doing so, they will not only be able to cushion their resources against market risks will 
but will also be able to maximise their returns successfully.

What is Portfolio Management?

Portfolio management's meaning can be explained as the process of managing individuals'
investments so that they maximise their earnings within a given time horizon. Furthermore, such
practices ensure that the capital invested by individuals is not exposed to too much market risk.

The entire process is based on the ability to make sound decisions. Typically, such a decision relates
to-achieving a profitable investment mix, allocating assets as per risk and financial goals and
diversifying resources to combat capital erosion.
