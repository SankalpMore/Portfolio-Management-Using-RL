Portfolio Management

To make the most of one's investment portfolio investors must participate actively in portfolio
management. By doing so, they will not only be able to cushion their resources against market risks will 
but will also be able to maximise their returns successfully.

What is Portfolio Management?

Portfolio management's meaning can be explained as the process of managing individuals'
investments so that they maximise their earnings within a given time horizon. Furthermore, such
practices ensure that the capital invested by individuals is not exposed to too much market risk.

The entire process is based on the ability to make sound decisions. Typically, such a decision relates
to-achieving a profitable investment mix, allocating assets as per risk and financial goals and
diversifying resources to combat capital erosion.


Why is Portfolio Management is important?

Portfolio management is important because it covers a certain amount of risk through diversification and shuffling of funds among different assets according to the returns they are generating. It also helps in planning regarding tax obligations. Moreover, it helps in arranging funds in times of emergencies.

For efficiently automate trading, We are going to use FinRL Library provided by  AI4Finance community .

FinRL is an open source deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for researchers and practitioners.

Reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent to solve tasks by trial and error, while DRL uses deep neural networks as function approximators. DRL balances exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge), and has been recognized as a competitive edge for automated trading. DRL framework is powerful in solving dynamic decision making problems by learning through interactions with an unknown environment, thus provides two major advantages: portfolio scalability and market model independence. In quantitative finance, automated trading is essentially making dynamic decisions, namely to decide where to trade, at what price, and what quantity, over a highly stochastic and complex stock market. Taking many complex financial factors into account, DRL trading agents build a multi-factor model and provide algorithmic trading strategies, which are difficult for human traders.
